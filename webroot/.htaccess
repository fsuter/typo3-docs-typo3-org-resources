# ###
# Provide special content for robots.txt
# If the domain is NOT docs.typo3.org, we want to deliver content for
# robots.txt that prohibits all. Though we have a [L] here, there is
# nevertheless an internal redirect being done because this is all
# defined in the .htaccess context.
# ###
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}    !^docs\.typo3\.org [NC]
RewriteRule ^robots\.txt$   /robots-for-srv123.txt [L]

# ###
# Task (A): Explicitly redirect everything to domain docs.typo3.org
#
# But: Do not do the redirect if we already have an (internal) redirect
#      done due to the above rule for robots.txt
#
# Better:
# But: Do not redirect if we are showing then contents of
#      robots-for-srv123.txt
# ###
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  !^docs\.typo3\.org [NC]

## This one does the job:
# RewriteCond %{ENV:REDIRECT_STATUS} ^$

## But this one is better and more precise:
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/robots-for-srv123.txt [NC]

RewriteRule ^(.*)         http://docs.typo3.org/$1 [L,R=301]


# ###
# /TYPO3/ has become /typo3cms/
# ###
RewriteRule  ^TYPO3/(.*)$  /typo3cms/$1  [NC,R=301,L]
# Also match the edge case that the URL is only "typo3"
RewriteRule  ^TYPO3$  /typo3cms/$1  [NC,R=301,L]

# ###
# .../Extensions/ has become /extensions/

### 
# http://forge.typo3.org/issues/44868 mb, 2013-01-28
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/typo3cms/Extensions # does not help!

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
